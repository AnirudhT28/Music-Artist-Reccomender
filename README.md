An artist recommendation system that takes in an input of an artist and returns the 10 most similar artists that you may not have known beforehand

Data Engineering (Python): A custom crawler using pylast that performs a depth-limited traversal of the Last.fm influence graph.

Graph Processing: NetworkX & SciPy to calculate the PageRank vector across over 3100 artists and 17,516 influence connections.

Backend (Java): Spring Boot + Spring Data JPA. I implemented native SQL joins to handle multi-hop graph discovery in milliseconds.

Frontend (JS/HTML): A responsive, Spotify-themed dashboard that visualizes "Compatibility %" using a normalized affinity scale

technical tools

Backend: Java 17, Spring Boot, Spring Data JPA, SQLite
